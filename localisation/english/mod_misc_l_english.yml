 ACROSS_THE_RHINE:0 "Across the Rhine (1v1)"
 ACROSS_THE_RHINE_DESC:0 "The banks of the Rhine have been graced with many a battle. From Arminius and his warbands and Charlemagne's Frankish warriors to the Napoleonic armies marching across the river. And now, it is visited by another match for the fate of Europe.\n\nAs the blue turns to red, choose your army and let the dice roll once more for the fates of all Europe."
 RED_OCTOBER:0 "At the Gates (1v1)"
 RED_OCTOBER_DESC:0 "Along the Volga, the water flows. This land was long fertile farmland. Soon, the blood of soldiers will water the fields to keep it fertile. To the North, the heart of Russia, Moscow lies open for a conqueror to be better than Napoleon ever war.\n\nThe heart of Russia lies open for the taking. The steppe eagle flies over the region, but it will find no rest, no maiden's song, nor river mist, apples or pears.\n\nIn the new world, there is only war."
 NASHIN_RON:0 "Nashin-Ron (2v2)"
 NASHIN_RON_DESC:0 "As one star sets, another rises. Where the Axis in the North has fortified itself on the mainland, the Allies have raised their flag in the South, ready to counter them. The many islands, once the arteries of trade are now the trenches, the islands the walls.\n\nThe ocean is a cold and cruel place and no mercy is shown to the loser. The winners shall shine bright while the loser will sink, forgotten by all."
 MARCO_POLO:0 "Marco Polo Bridge (1v1)"
 MARCO_POLO_DESC:0 "Once, this was the lands of the Mongol hordes, sweeping down from the North to conquer and raid China. Now, it is the home of another battle in yet another war for supremacy. As the last in the line of conquerors or defenders, defeat your enemy, command them to step aside.\n\nThere can be no ties, no white peace or negotiated surrenders. There is only total victory or total oblivion."
 INDIAN_SUNRISE:0 "Jewel (1v1)"
 INDIAN_SUNRISE_DESC:0 "India has seen powers come and go. Native to the region and foreign to the inhabitants, the Jewel stands gleaming in the light with its riches. Two factions, two powers now stand opposed to each other for control of this pristine stone.\n\nChannel the spirit of the Mughals and the Hindu kingdoms, and unite India under one flag."
 SONNENBLUME:0 "Sonnenblume (1v1)"
 SONNENBLUME_DESC:0 "North Africa has seen armies come and go over the years. From the Romans and the Carthaginians, to the Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli and Algeria, the desert sands at the fringes of the Sahara hide the blood of soldiers across the centuries and millenia.\n\nAnd it is time for the region to play host to yet another struggle, yet another set of battles. In the scorching heat of the sun, as the only blooms are the explosions from the muzzles of their guns, which faction will triumph?"
 SCANDINAVIA_GAME:0 "Nordwind (1v1)"
 SCANDINAVIA_GAME_DESC:0 "The North Remembers!\n\nThe North remembers the days when it was inhabited by warriors and vikings. As the Axis and Allies now fight it out, and the North once more sees war, it awakens. Two factions enter, but only one may leave. Only one will be worthy of being the inheritor of the Vikings and their legacy. As the frigid northern wind blows, those words ring true.\n\nOnly One is Worthy."
 SPAIN:0 "Dragoon (2v2)"
 SPAIN_DESC:0 "This region was once the site for battles that would decide two millenia of history afterwards. The Punic Wars. A clash of civilizations, of nations, and of ideas.\n\nOnce more, a struggle for victory has emerged in this ancient region.\n\nLet loose the dogs of war, and in the spirit of Hannibal and Scipio master the western Mediterranean."
 VALHALLA:0 "Valhalla (2v2)"
 VALHALLA_DESC:0 "From the entrance of the Belts, to the icefloes of the White Sea, Valhalla, the warrior's heaven beckons for another war to visit the North and for the soldiers and their commanders to show their mettle and their cunning against their foes.\n\nThe Allies, in the West have managed a foothold against the Axis stronghold in the East.\n\nBetween them lie the lands that so many other armies have clashed over before. Choose your faction and let yet another war grace these lands."
 RED_OCTOBER2v2:0 "Rodina (2v2)"
 RED_OCTOBER2v2_DESC:0 "From the earliest stirrings of water, and the shakings of life, the plains of these lands have been trampled underneath the hooves, feet, treads of many an army. The Huns back then, the Swedes even the Ottomans. Alas, while this region would like to know peace, once more, the trumpets of war sound.\n\nTake command, crush the adversaries and triumph so that this place may finally, maybe, know peace."

shocktroop_keystone_1:0 "Support Shock Army"
shocktroop_keystone_1_desc:0 "Shock Troops can no longer operate independently without the help of engineers and fire support elements. To be able to accomplish their goals, Shock Troops must work hand and hand with support elements to be able to break the enemy."
shocktroop_level_2_a:0 "Sustained Battle"
shocktroop_level_2_a_desc:0 "Shock Troops should stay as long as they can in battle. Shock Troops need to deal as much damage to enemy forces as possible so they are weakened when larger offensive operations do occur."
shocktroop_level_2_b:0 "Probing Attacks"
shocktroop_level_2_b_desc:0 "By using probing attacks we can better identify enemy weaknesses in their lines."
shocktroop_keystone_2:0 "Integrated Engineers"
shocktroop_keystone_2_desc:0 "Engineer support is critical to any kind of specialized operations. Working closer with them in our units provides our troops with the tools they need when they need them."

shocktroop_level_3_b_desc:0 "Giving our shock troops more tools to breakthrough enemy lines is key to helping them do what they're meant to do; break enemy lines."

second_guerilla_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
second_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "There is a need to reform the operational methods of the armed forces. The reality is that the armies that could potentially be engaged in conflict possess a significant advantage. Therefore, adopting an asymmetrical approach to warfare becomes crucial in order to have a chance at achieving success or maintaining a competitive edge."
double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
double_envelopment_desc:0 "Envelopment, an age-old military tactic, can be employed when the enemy's forces are overextended and we possess superior knowledge of the terrain. By quickly surrounding and eliminating small enemy groups, we can prevent assistance and disrupt their larger forces, gaining a tactical advantage."
elastic_defence:0 "Elastic Defense"
elastic_defence_desc:0 "Instead of concentrating all strength on the front line, an elastic defense strategy involves establishing a "deeper" layer of defenses. This approach provides the defender with additional time to react and launch counter-attacks, while the attacker becomes dispersed and entangled."
infiltration_assault:0 "Infiltration Assault"
infiltration_assault_desc:0 "During the initial stages of an attack, infantry units should focus on identifying and targeting vulnerable points in the enemy's defensive line. By bypassing and isolating these weaker sections, the remaining attacking forces can then concentrate their efforts on neutralizing the more heavily fortified areas."
second_infiltration_in_depth:0 "Deep Infiltration"
second_infiltration_in_depth_desc:0 "Our forces are now trained to bypass and isolate enemy strongpoints to a much greater depth. Ideally, our assault forces should not stop until they reach the enemy's rear areas and their forces are entirely cut off."
backhand_blow:0 "Backhand Blow"
backhand_blow_desc:0 "Instead of engaging in a battle for every inch of ground, it is often more advantageous to avoid direct confrontation with enemy penetrations. Instead, the enemy is allowed to extend themselves, and when they have overcommitted, counterattacks can be launched to cut off and destroy them."
